In this article I'm going to review how did I manage to be hired as a freelancer for the first time. There are many people that want to work independently, but don’t know how to get started.

One of the most difficult parts of this journey is the very beginning. I'm not going to talk about how to work as a freelancer in general. The idea of the present article is to tell you my personal story, hoping to give you a broad idea of how to get your first client as a freelancer.

## Do I need a formal education to work as a freelancer?

Not every freelancer has a formal education in the area of work. I know many great software developers with a successful career who haven’t any university degree. Maybe they did one or two online courses, and then they landed their first client.

My case is similar. I do have a formal education with a university degree, but I currently work in a different area (FYI, I studied Physics and I work as a Python Developer, among other similar programming areas).

If you are wondering if I could have made a career without a formal education, even though I don't work specifically in that area, I couldn't answer. Maybe if I didn’t have any formal education, I wouldn’t be working as a freelancer at all. Who knows?

I believe that things have changed over the years, in the sense that many clients will seek you for the experience you have, or the portfolio you can show them instead of a university title.

## What made me go for freelance work?

Before I started freelancing, I didn't know what my future would look like regarding my work life. I was actually being frustrated, because I couldn’t get a decent job in my country that was related to my university title.

I really enjoyed the career I made, but by the time I started looking for a job I felt nothing was what I would like. My two main options were basically making a doctorate or dedicate myself to teaching. But I wanted more than that.

Freelancing sounded like a good option for me. I knew some people with similar background as mine that worked in an independent way, and also they did it online. I decided to dive deeper and investigate more on this world.

## How did I learned about freelancing?

A (not so) quick google search led me to a couple of interesting sites where one could get jobs as a freelancer. The websites I found required to sign up for a free account and submit some basic information like the name and country of origin.

I haven’t had any clue what the sites were really about, so for the sake of curiosity I followed along with the registration and information filling process.

Once I finished with the very basics, I learned that people posted job offerings on the platform. I found many of them offering both short and long term positions, and asking for skills relevant to my knowledge.

## How did I get hired for the first time?

In order to get hired in one of these freelancing platforms, one needs to have a fully completed profile. This includes all the personal information the platform requires, and additionally a kind of curriculum with your education and the work experience you may have.

Once I completed all the steps, I applied for some of the available positions I thought were the best match for me. After many rejections, I finally got hired by a student who needed help with understanding some calculus topics. This was great because I had experience with the topic and also about teaching. The plus is that it was in Spanish, which is my native language.

## How much did I get paid for my first freelancing job?

After finishing the job for my first client, everything went great. He was very happy with my help, and he was able to pass the course. Now comes the time of the payment!

The amount paid for this first job was discussed before he actually hired me. This is an important aspect of freelancing, specially if you decide working this way on your own, outside any platform.

The actual amount I got paid for this first job was something close to $5. It wasn’t much, but I knew it was a good starting point if I wanted to continue working this way.

You should always discuss the job price and the scope of it before getting hired, in order to avoid any potential discussions and disagreements.

## Freelancing after being hired for the first time

After finishing the first freelancing job, clients usually leave you feedback. That is, if the client was happy with the work done, they can leave a message and score that appears in your public profile. 

This is great and super helpful to get the second client, because now you not only have your profile filled with your work experience, but an additional item from the platform itself, and with real feedback from the client.

When clients look for someone to work with, they generally give more importance to these kind of feedbacks than the other experience you may have. And they lastly look at your university degrees or certifications (those are usually ignored by clients).

So, less than a week after finishing my first job, I was invited for another one! And in this case I didn’t even need to apply for the job myself. The client sent me an invitation directly, because he found my profile with the skills he was looking for.

Actually he didn’t just invite me to work for him. Clients send invitations to many freelancers and they decide who to work with depending on how the interview goes on. I responded to the invitation very quickly, and he ended up hiring me for the job.

This second client was one of the best ones I had in my entire freelancing career so far. I learned so much working for him, both on the technical part of the job and the freelancing side too. Another great thing about this client is that at the end of the contract he left a tremendously great feedback, which again helped me a lot to get more and more clients.
