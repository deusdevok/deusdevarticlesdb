This section of the basic Python course is intended for you to practice what you have learned so far. There is a lot you can do with what you already learned, and in this short article you are getting a couple of ideas for practice projects. Let’s get started and have fun!

## Rock, paper, scissors game

This is a two player game where each of them randomly chooses between rock, paper or scissors. In this case you can make a user play against the computer. You can read more about this popular game in the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors). The basic rules are:

- Rock beats scissors
- Paper beats rock
- Scissors beats paper

The Python program can work like the following after executing the script:

```
Game number 1
Rock (R), paper (P) or scissors (S)? (Q to quit): R
You have chosen Rock, while the computer chose Paper
You lost

Game number 2
Rock (R), paper (P) or scissors (S)? (Q to quit): p
You have chosen Paper, while the computer chose Rock
You won!

Game number 3
Rock (R), paper (P) or scissors (S)? (Q to quit): S
You have chosen Scissors, while the computer chose Rock
You lost

Game number 4
Rock (R), paper (P) or scissors (S)? (Q to quit): T

Game number 4
Rock (R), paper (P) or scissors (S)? (Q to quit): r
You have chosen Rock, while the computer chose Scissors
You won!

Game number 5
Rock (R), paper (P) or scissors (S)? (Q to quit): r
You have chosen Rock, while the computer chose Scissors
You won!

Game number 6
Rock (R), paper (P) or scissors (S)? (Q to quit): P
You have chosen Paper, while the computer chose Scissors
You lost

Game number 7
Rock (R), paper (P) or scissors (S)? (Q to quit): q
Thank you for playing!
You won 3 out of 6 games (50.00%)

The user plays against the computer one game after another as long as the user doesn’t choose the option to quit, which can be the letter Q. Here is a list of things to consider for the Python script:

1. In order to play games indefinitely until a condition is met (choosing Q to quit) you can make use of a `while` loop. There are a couple of ways to do it, but one popular way to make an infinite loop is to do use `while True`.
2. The program needs to prompts the player (you) for either rock, paper or scissors. Remember you can use the `input()` function for this.
3. The computer also needs to choose between rock, paper or scissors. You could make use of the `random` module to randomly choose between the three options, particularly with the `choice()` function.
4. In each game you need to check who won, or if there was a tie. For this you could make a series of `if-else` and possibly `elif` statements. For example, if the user chose Rock and the computer chose Scissors, then the user won the game.
5. You could keep a score of the game by using a variable `score`, initially being equal to 0. Each game you win adds up one point to the final score. Remember you can increase a variable with `score += 1`.
